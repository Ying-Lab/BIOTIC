Introduction
-----
BIOTIC (A Bayesian model to Integrate single-cell Multi-Omics for Transcription Factor Activity Inference to Characterize Cell Identity) is an innovative Bayesian model for multi-omics data that incorporates priori knowledge of the gene regulation process into generation process, and the causal relationship of gene regulation into the inference process.

BIOTIC is generated by Python 3.8 and the R 4.2.1 is used during preprocessing
